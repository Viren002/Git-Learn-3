Trying to add 2nd text file. 

what I understood is that to add in my own repo, I need to initialize an empty repo without
any kind of files, including README.md file" .

if there are pre-added files in the initialized repo then I will have to clone that repo locally 
then merge my changed my files into the cloned repo .
